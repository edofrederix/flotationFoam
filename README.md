# FlotationFoam

This code accompanies the paper "Simulation of noble metal particle growth and
removal in the molten salt fast reactor" by E.M.A. Frederix and E.M.J. Komen.

## Authors

FlotationFoam is developed by Edo Frederix as part of the SAMOSAFER H2020
Euroatom project at the Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group (NRG),
Westerduinweg 3, 1755 LE Petten, the Netherlands. This project has received
funding from the Euratom research and training program 2019â€“2023, under grant
agreement No. 847527.

## License

FlotationFoam is published under the GNU GPL Version 3 license.

## Prerequisites

* OpenFOAM-10 Foundation version. While it may compile against other versions,
  this is not tested and currently not supported.
* LogMoM: https://github.com/edofrederix/LogMoM

## Usage

* Make sure that OpenFOAM-10 is loaded into your environment
* Download and compile the LogMoM library (see its README)
* Compile flotationFoam with

<pre>
./Allwmake
</pre>

* All cases can be run using

<pre>
./prep.sh <args>
multiphaseEulerFoam
</pre>

* The prep shell scripts set up the case by configuring the required parameters.
  For the MSFR2D case, a four arguments must be provided: number of cells per
  unit length, inlet size distribution sigma, inlet size distribution Sauter
  mean diameter and helium mass flow rate.
* Some cases can also be run in parallel, with

<pre>
./prep.sh
mpirun -np 4 multiphaseEulerFoam -parallel
</pre>

* To reconstruct the results from the paper, use the MSFR2D case with the
  appropriate parameters

## Using flotationFoam in your own OpenFOAM cases

The flotation model is provided as an fvModel. When compiled, it can be
dynamically loaded into your OpenFOAM case by adding

<pre>
libs
(
    "libflotation.so"
);
</pre>

to your case's `system/controlDict` file. Next, you can select the flotation
model by adding

<pre>
flotation
{
    type    flotation;
}
</pre>

to `constant/fvModels`. Finally, your case should provide initial and boundary
conditions for the `Nf.#` and `Nc.#` fields, which are the free and captured
number concentration fields for section `#`. See the cases directory for a few
examples.

## Contact & support

For bug reports or support, feel free to contact Edo Frederix at
frederix@nrg.eu. Please note that this code is not maintained nor regularly
updated, and is only tested with OpenFOAM-10. Questions related to other
versions will thus not be answered.
